## What is ChromeHtmlToPdf?

ChromeHtmlToPdf is a 100% managed C# .NET library and console application that can be used to convert HTML to PDF format with the use of Google Chrome

## Why this fork?

We needed a .Net standard, async, thread safe version and needed the MIME handling to behave exactly like chrome with no changes to the original document. 
Please see the original version as that may suit your needs better.
